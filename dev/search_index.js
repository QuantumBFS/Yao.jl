/>\n\nLet's now consider the energy cost function directly over the special unitary group mathcalL textSU(2^n) rightarrow mathbbR\n\nmathcalL(U) = textTrHUrho_0U^dagger\n\nTo minimize the cost function we can follow the Riemannian gradient flow defined through the following differential equation\n\ndotU = -textgradmathcalL(U) = Urho_0U^dagger HU\n\nDiscretizing the flow we get the following recursive update rule\n\nU_k + 1 = expalphaU_krho_0U^dagger_k HU_k = expalpharho_k HU_k\n\nwhere alpha is the appropriate learning rate and U_0 = I.\n\nWe can expand the commutator in the exponent in the basis of Pauli strings P^j\n\nrho_k H = frac12^nsum_j = 1^4^n - 1omega^j_kP^j\n\nwhere\n\nomega^j_k = textTrrho_k HP^j = textTrH P^jrho_k = langleH P^jrangle_rho_k\n\nIt turns out that omega^j_k can easily be evaluated with the help of a parameter shift rule\n\nomega^j_k = langleH P^jrangle_rho_k = -ilangle V^dagger_j(pi4)HV_j(pi4) - V^dagger_j(-pi4)HV_j(-pi4)rangle_rho_k\n\nwhere V_j(t) = exp-itP^j.\n\nNext, we write a function for generation of 2-local Pauli operators. We will restrict the Riemannian gradient to this subspace of the Lie algebra since otherwise the number of parameters to calculate would be 4^8 - 1 = 65535 which is too much for a reasonable runtime of the algorithm.\n\nfunction generate_2local_pauli_strings(n)\n    pauli_strings = []\n    for i = 1:n\n        push!(pauli_strings, kron(n, i => X))\n        push!(pauli_strings, kron(n, i => Y))\n        push!(pauli_strings, kron(n, i => Z))\n    end\n    for i = 1:n-1\n        for j = i+1:n\n            for P1 in [X, Y, Z]\n                for P2 in [X, Y, Z]\n                    push!(pauli_strings, kron(n, i => P1, j => P2))\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    pauli_strings\nend;\n\nNext we write functions for calculating the expansion coefficients and a single optimization step. We will absorb the factor of 12^n into the learning rate.\n\nfunction calculate_omegas(n, reg, h, pauli_strings)\n    iω = []\n    for P in pauli_strings\n        push!(iω, real(expect(h, reg => time_evolve(P, π/4)) - expect(h, reg => time_evolve(P, -π/4))))\n    end\n    iω\nend;\n\nfunction step_and_cost!(n, circuit, h, α, pauli_strings)\n    iω = calculate_omegas(n, zero_state(n) |> circuit, h, pauli_strings)\n\n    for (iωʲ, P) in zip(iω, pauli_strings)\n        if abs(iωʲ) > 1e-6 # we will only keep the ones that actually contribute\n            append!(circuit, chain(n, time_evolve(P, -α * iωʲ)))\n        end\n    end\n\n    real(expect(h, zero_state(n) => circuit))\nend;\n\nFinally, let's try it out. We initialize the state 0rangle and apply several optimization steps.\n\ncircuit = chain(n)\npauli_strings = generate_2local_pauli_strings(n)\nhistory = Float64[]\n\nfor i=1:100\n    cost = step_and_cost!(n, circuit, h, 0.01, pauli_strings)\n    push!(history, cost)\nend\n\nPlots.plot(history, legend=false)\nPlots.plot!(1:100, [w[1] for i=1:100])\nxlabel!(\"steps\")\nylabel!(\"energy\")\n\n<img src=\"/assets/images/Riemannian.png\" alt=\"Riemannian gradient flow\" width=\"600\"/>\n\nWhen we compare the final states achieved with the Riemannian gradient flow optimizer and with the standard VQE we can notice that the former has lower quality. This is because the Riemannian gradient flow optimizer has only a local view of the cost landscape while VQE can access these directions since the ansatz we used is universal. However, if we were able to calculate all of the 4^n - 1 projections, Riemannian gradient flow optimizer would be guaranteed to converge given the appropriate learning rate!\n\n\n\nThis page was generated using Literate.jl.","category":"section"},{"location":"dev/index.html#Developer-Notes","page":"Developer Notes","title":"Developer Notes","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"dev/index.html#Overview-of-the-Architecture","page":"Developer Notes","title":"Overview of the Architecture","text":"The following is an overview of the entire ecosystem, where Yao and CuYao are two meta-packages.\n\n(Image: stack)","category":"section"},{"location":"dev/index.html#The-role-of-QBIR","page":"Developer Notes","title":"The role of QBIR","text":"Currently the main functionality is built on the Quantum Block Intermediate Representation (QBIR).

In general, operators appears in a quantum circuit can be divided into Composite Blocks and Primitive Blocks.\n\nWe follow the low abstraction principle and thus each block represents a certain approach of calculation. The simplest Composite Block is a Chain Block, which chains other blocks (oracles) with the same number of qubits together.

All factory methods can be lazy evaluate the first arguements, which is the number of qubits. It will return a lambda function that requires a single interger input. The instance of desired block will only be constructed until all the information is filled. When you filled all the information in somewhere of the declaration, 幺 will be able to infer the others.

QFT to an external block","text":"In most cases, functions are enough to wrap quantum circuits, like A and B we defined above, but sometimes, we need to dispatch specialized methods on certain kinds of quantum circuit, or we want to define an external block to export, thus, it's useful to be able to wrap circuit to custom blocks.\n\nFirst, we define a new type as subtype of PrimitiveBlock since we are not going to use the subblocks of QFT, if you need to use its subblocks, it'd be better to define it under CompositeBlock.\n\nstruct QFT <: PrimitiveBlock{2}\n

matrix\n\nYaoBlocks.mat(::Type{T}, x::QFT) where T = mat(T, circuit(x))\n\nYou may notice, it is a little ugly to print QFT at the moment, this is because we print the type summary by default, you can define your own printing by overloading print_block\n\nYaoBlocks.print_block(io::IO, x::QFT) = print(io, \"QFT($(x.n))\")\n\nSince it is possible to use FFT to simulate the results of QFT (like cheating), we could define our custom apply! method:\n\nusing FFTW, LinearAlgebra\n\nfunction YaoBlocks.apply!(r::ArrayReg, x::QFT)\n    α = sqrt(length(statevec(r)))\n    invorder!(r)\n    lmul!(α, ifft!(statevec(r)))\n    return r\nend\n\nNow let's check if our apply! method is correct:\n\nr = rand_state(5)\nr1 = r |> copy |> QFT(5)\nr2 = r |> copy |> circuit(QFT(5))\nr1 ≈ r2\n\ntrue\n\nWe can get iQFT (inverse QFT) directly by calling adjoint\n\nQFT(5)'\n\n [†]QFT(5)\n\nQFT and iQFT are different from FFT and IFFT in three ways,\n\nthey are different by a factor of sqrt2^n with n the

FFT.","category":"section"},{"location":"generated/examples/2.qft-phase-estimation/index.html#Phase-Estimation","page":"Quantum Fourier Transformation and Phase Estimation","title":"Phase

and Hadamard on first n qubits, we could use Subroutine, which creates a context of a sub-scope of the qubits.\n\nPE(n, m, U) =\n    chain(n+m, # total number of the qubits\n

space to store phase ϕ, and the other m qubits as the input state which corresponds to an eigenvector of oracle matrix U.\n\nThe subroutine here uses focus! and relax! to manage a local scope of quantum circuit, and only activate the first n qubits while applying the block inside the subroutine context, and the scope will be relax!ed back, after the context. This is equivalent to manually focus! then relax!\n\nfullly activated\n\nr = rand_state(5)\n\nArrayReg{2, ComplexF64, Array...}\n    active qubits: 5/5\n    nlevel: 2\n\nfirst 3 qubits
