*A General Purpose Quantum Computation Simulation Framework*

Welcome to [Yao](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl), a **Flexible**, **Extensible**, **Efficient** Framework for
Quantum Algorithm Design. **Yao** (幺) is the Chinese character for unitary. It is also means the first (一) in Chinese
(it is the first released package from [QuantumBFS](https://github.com/QuantumBFS)).

We aim to provide a powerful tool for researchers, students to study and explore quantum computing in near term
future, before quantum computer being used in large-scale.
