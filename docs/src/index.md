# Yao

*A General Purpose Quantum Computation Simulation Framework*

Welcome to [Yao](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl), a **Flexible**, **Extensible**, **Efficient** Framework for
Quantum Algorithm Design. **Yao** (å¹º) is the Chinese character for normalized but not orthogonal.

We aim to provide a powerful tool for researchers, students to study and explore quantum computing in near term
future, before quantum computer being used in large-scale.
